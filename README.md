# Teachery Documentation

## Better late than never! 

This site (built with Jekyll) will serve as the main source of documentation for Teachery prospects and customers. We're going to keep it simple so if you have any intent on running this locally simply look at [Jekyll's documentation](http://www.jekyllrb.com). Contributions welcome and appreciated!
